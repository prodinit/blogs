# Enable Cloudwatch Alarm and SNS Topic for AWS Billing Alert

Hello viewers. If you are someone who owns a root account of AWS or has a free-tier AWS account then billing must be something that makes you feel very terrified until you are extremely richðŸ˜œ

So, in this blog, we will be configuring a cloud watch alarm that triggers and sends an email to the root account when the billing amount exceeds a threshold value. Easy Peasy.

FYI, If you have signed up for a free tier account. You already have 10 free cloud watch alarms and 1000 free email notifications each monthâ€¦

Letâ€™s Begin

#### Go to the Billing Dashboard -> Billing Preferences

Check **Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts** -> Add **Email Address** -> Check **Receive Billing Alerts** -> Click **Save Preferences**

Post this, Click on **Manage Billing Alerts.** It will redirect you to Cloud watch page. We will now create a Billing cloud watch alarm.
